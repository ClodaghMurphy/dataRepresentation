Trying to get results out of a particular document
on a website that has lots of similar documents.

It is all there but you need to write smart commands
to extract the info in a way that is human readable.
You need to take it incrementally also
first get the list
then get data contained in the list

*In relation to the pagination piece, you are again using terms
that are particular to the resource
